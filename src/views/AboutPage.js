      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">About Me</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Hi, I'm <strong>Luca Cirio</strong>, born in 2000. <br/> 
        I have always been described as a curious person, and it is thanks to this trait that today, I am a programmer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Starting from the Beginning...</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I've always been a cheerful person, someone who makes others feel secure, whether they're young or old. This characteristic has helped me form friendships easily and, on a professional level, become a point of reference for many people.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">A Bit About My Journey...</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        After finishing middle school in 2013, I, like many other teenagers, faced a decision that no 13-year-old is truly prepared to make : <br/> <strong className='text-gray-800'>What educational path should I choose?</strong><br/> I knew this question wasn't simple. Behind that question mark lay many doubts...
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It's crazy to think that at 13, you're expected to choose a high school path that could shape your career for, who knows, maybe 40 years. In 2014, I chose a vocational school in the Electrical/Industrial sector. <br/> Unfortunately, the training I received was outdated by over 50 years, making the skills I acquired nearly useless in most modern industries.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Work and Growth...</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Fortunately, after finishing school, I received fantastic news: I would start working alongside the most important figure in my life — my father. <br/> The job involved working in the metalworking industry, doing maintenance and assistance on machinery. I started this job in 2017 and continued until the end of 2023, gaining a wealth of professional skills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        From handling client calls to organizing work, solving problems outside my expertise, traveling abroad to unknown companies, preparing spare parts in the warehouse, to working under the scrutiny of managers, I did it all. <br/> I even had to lead and assign tasks to people much older than me. However, something changed in me after the COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">A Change of Heart...</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I've always been adaptable, but in 2022, during a trip to Barcelona, I had a moment of clarity. While having breakfast, I looked around and noticed that 90% of the people were working on laptops. This made me reflect deeply. I’ve always loved the idea of working in a "smart" way — where you can balance work, home, and life while doing something you truly enjoy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong className='text-gray-800'>Do I really want to continue a job that has been the same for centuries, without living the life I've always wanted?</strong> <br/> When I returned from that trip, my mind had only one answer : <strong className='text-black text-xl'>NO.</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Without hesitation, I dove headfirst into the world of programming. I started with a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800">Udemy</a> to learn the key concepts and get into a developer's mindset. In 2024, I consolidated everything I had learned and enrolled in a comprehensive course with <a href="https://boolean.careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800">BOOLEAN S.R.L.</a> to take my skills to the next level and begin this new career for real.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Staying Balanced...</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I've always believed in one key principle : <br/> <strong className='text-gray-800'>It's important to keep both your body and mind in shape.</strong> The human mind gets bored doing the same thing endlessly, so <strong className='text-gray-800'>exploring the world, training my body, and freeing my mind through meditation</strong> are the three pillars of who I am.
